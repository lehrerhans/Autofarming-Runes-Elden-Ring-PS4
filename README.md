How to modify an PS4 Controller to do Autofarming Runes in Eldenring.

I bought an cheap PS4 Controller and modded it with an ESP32 so the controller will automatically farm Runes in Eldenring.
What you need:
- PS4 with Eldenring with the weapon, that is dropped by the Eldenbeast.
- ESP32
- PS4 Controller from Action Market. A normal PS4 Controller can also be modded, but here i explain only the Action Market Controller
